Genomic Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of genomic data to identify genes, proteins, and other genomic features from metagenomic samples. Utilizing a suite of bioinformatics tools and R for data visualization, the pipeline processes raw sequencing reads, performs assembly, gene prediction, functional annotation, and visualizes key metrics such as contig lengths, GC content, and coverage.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Conda environment
Python 3.9
R 4.1.0
Snakemake
Bioinformatics tools: BWA, Samtools, MegaHit, Trimmomatic, Prodigal
NCBI datasets CLI
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository URL]
cd [repository name]
Set up the Conda environment:

bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ngs-analysis-core
Download and prepare the reference genome and raw reads:

Refer to the download_genome_data and download_reads rules in the Snakefile for instructions.

Usage
Configure your analysis:

Edit the config/config.yaml file to specify your samples, paths to raw reads, and other configuration options.

Run the pipeline:

bash
Copy code
snakemake --use-conda --cores [number_of_cores]
Replace [number_of_cores] with the number of CPU cores you wish to use.

Pipeline Steps
Read Preprocessing: Quality control and trimming of raw reads.
Genome Assembly: Assembling reads into contigs.
Alignment: Mapping reads back to the reference genome.
Gene Prediction: Identifying gene structures in the assembled genome.
Functional Annotation: Annotating predicted genes with functional information.
Visualization: Generating visual summaries of key metrics.
Visualization
The visualization step produces a PDF report containing:

Distribution of contig lengths
GC content across contigs
Coverage depth distribution
Additional plots as configured
See the visualize_results rule in the Snakefile for more details.
